Instagram Clone — AI Powered Detection of Synthetic Content
Project Overview

This project is an Instagram-like social media web application enhanced with Artificial Intelligence to detect synthetic / AI-generated media content (fake images and videos).

The goal is to simulate how modern platforms can identify manipulated or AI-generated media to improve trust and safety in social networks.

 Objectives

Build an Instagram-style frontend interface

Allow users to upload images and videos

Detect whether uploaded media is:

Real or AI Generated / Manipulated

Display detection results inside the application

Demonstrate AI integration in social media platforms

AI Features

The AI module performs:

Image Detection

Classifies images as Real vs Synthetic

Video Detection

Extracts frames from video

Runs classification on frames

Aggregates results for final prediction
